<p class="tab"><b>Abstract</b>: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), like other national statistical 
offices, is considering the opportunities of differential privacy (DP). This research considers 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) TableBuilder perturbation methodology in a 
DP framework. DP and the ABS perturbation methodology are applying the same idea 
– infusing noise to the underlying microdata – to protect aggregate statistical outputs. 
This research describes some differences between these approaches. Our findings show 
that noise infusion protects against disclosure risks in the aggregate Census Tables. We 
highlight areas of future ABS research on this topic.

<p class="tab"><b>Abstract</b>: The proofs of SAI in the literature are either flawed, too condensed or do 
not give the necessary background. The motivation for this report is thus to provide a concise, self-contained 
proof of SAI. The report also includes all the necessary background to understand SAI and its proof.</p>

<h3>Selected Talks</h3>

<ul>

<p></p><li>8/11/2019 <em>The Promises of Differential Privacy</em>, ABS Seminar
<p class="tab"><b>Abstract</b>: Differential privacy (DP) has emerged in the last decade from the computer science literature as a way of measuring the privacy risk associated with statistical outputs. In this talk, we will outline some of the promises of DP and motivate why MD is investigating this area.
</p>
</li>

<p></p><li>1/10/2019 <em>Using Admin Data and Machine Learning to Predict Dwelling Occupancy on Census Night</em>, Statistical Society of Australia's Young Statisticians Conference
<p class="tab"><b>Abstract</b>: The Australian Census of Population and Housing (the Census) aims to count every person in Australia on a particular night – called the Census night. Houses which do not complete a Census form and do not respond to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) follow-up campaign, pose a complication to achieving this aim: Are these dwellings unoccupied, or are they occupied and the residents unresponsive? To achieve its aim, the Census should count these unresponsive residents, but how can the ABS accurately do this? To answer these questions, the ABS has developed a model which uses administrative data – collected by various government and non-government organisations – to predict the occupancy status of a dwelling. There are various challenges surrounding this new method, including the lack of ground truth, and the presence of strongly unbalanced classes . However, the method will improve the accuracy of ABS Census population counts and has been adopted as part of the 2021 Australian Census imputation process.

<p></p><li>2/9/2019 <em>New Statistical Attacks on Population Count Tables</em>, ABS Seminar
<p class="tab"><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, three new statistical attacks affecting population count tables have caught our attention: 1) the US Census Bureau reconstruction attack on their 2010 census data; 2) a differencing attack exploiting non-additive perturbation mechanisms; and 3) a split averaging attack. A key feature uniting all of these attacks is the requirement of significant computing resources, in addition to the underlying mathematical theory. This talk will describe these attack methods and outline some of the work we and other NSOs have done arising from these attacks. I will also quickly run through the perturbation mechanism used in TableBuilder, as a pre-requisite for understanding whether we are vulnerable to these attacks.
